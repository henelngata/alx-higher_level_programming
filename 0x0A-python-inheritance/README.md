**Python programming is awesome** due to its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for beginners. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python also has a large standard library that includes areas like internet protocols, string operations, web services tools and operating system interfaces.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects". Objects are instances of classes, which can hold both variables (attributes) and functions (methods). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

In Python, everything is treated as an object which can be a number, a string, a function or even a class. This is often referred to as "first-class everything".

A class is a blueprint for creating objects in an OOP language. It defines a set of attributes and methods that characterize any object of the class.

An object is an instance of a class. While a class is a blueprint, an object is a copy of the class with actual values. The difference between a class and an object, is that class is a blueprint which is used to create different objects of the same type.

An attribute is a named property of a class. It has a type and is assigned a value.

In Python, public, protected and private are three types of access modifiers. Public attributes can be accessed from anywhere. Protected attributes shouldn't be accessed outside of the class definition, unless inside of a subclass definition. Private attributes are not accessible from outside the class.

The `self` parameter in Python represents the instance of the class and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

A method is a function that is associated with a class.

The `__init__` method in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is instantiated.

Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding are basic concepts of OOP. Data Abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details. Data Encapsulation is bundling the data and the methods that use them. Information Hiding is the practice of hiding the details of a function or an object, reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.

A property in Python provides a way to customize access to instance data. It created by @property decorator.

In Python, an attribute is a variable that is bound to an instance or class. A property is a special kind of attribute that is defined by methods.

Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python is by using the @property (for getter) and @attribute.setter (for setter) decorators.

The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python represent the class objects as a string. The `__str__` method in Python represents the object for the end user while `__repr__` method is meant to be an unambiguous representation of the object and should be used for debugging and development. `__repr__`'s goal is to be unambiguous while `__str__`'s goal is to be readable.

A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object. It is shared between all the objects of this class and it is defined outside the constructor function of the class, `__init__`(), and right after the class definition.

The difference between an object attribute and a class attribute, is that class attributes are shared among all instances of a class. When we change the value of a class attribute, it will be changed for all instances.

A class method is a method that is bound to a class and not the instance of the class. They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.

A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class.

In Python, you can add new attributes, and even new methods, to an object on the fly, it's called monkey patching.

The `__dict__` attribute is a dictionary object in Python that is a special attribute used to store the writable attributes of an object or class.

The `getattr()` function is used to get the value of an object's attribute and it returns the default value if no attribute of the object is found.
