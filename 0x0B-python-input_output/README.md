Why Python programming is awesome:
Python is versatile, easy to learn, and has a simple and readable syntax.
It offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various purposes.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python has a strong community and extensive documentation, making it easy to find help and resources.
How to open a file:
Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('r' for read, 'w' for write, 'a' for append, etc.) as arguments.
How to write text in a file:
Open the file in write mode ('w' or 'a').
Use the write() method to write text to the file.
How to read the full content of a file:
Open the file in read mode ('r').
Use the read() method to read the entire content of the file into a string.
How to read a file line by line:
Open the file in read mode ('r').
Use a loop to iterate over the file object, which will yield each line of the file.
How to move the cursor in a file:
After opening the file, you can use the seek() method to move the cursor to a specific position in the file.
How to make sure a file is closed after using it:
Use the close() method on the file object after you finish reading from or writing to the file.
What is and how to use the with statement:
The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block of code with methods defined by a context manager.
It ensures that the context manager's __exit__() method is always called, even if an error occurs within the block of code.
What is JSON:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
What is serialization:
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later.
What is deserialization:
Deserialization is the process of converting a serialized data structure or object back into its original format.
How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string:
Use the json.dumps() function to serialize a Python data structure (e.g., dictionary, list) into a JSON string.
How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure:
Use the json.loads() function to deserialize a JSON string into a Python data structure (e.g., dictionary, list).
